1. Built a Naïve Bayes Classifier in Python using Naïve Bayes trained statistical model. 
2. Applied this classifier to predict the genders of the authors of blog posts. The corpora had 3232 blog posts to be classified, and I made 3000 of them as training data, and the rest of them were used as the test.
